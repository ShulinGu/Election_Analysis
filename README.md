## Election-Audit Summary:
  - The script provided can be used for any election. For any counting and summary of the dataset, we need to create a list, dictionary and initialize a string and a variable. Using the for loop after "with open", only remember to change the term you want to analize. And now the script can run and summarize the data.
  - The script can also be modified to find out the smallest votes and losing candidate. Simply change the ">" to "<" in the if statement.
